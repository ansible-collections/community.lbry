# Vagrant LBRY regtest environment

This is an attempt to setup a LBRY regtest environment using Vagrant. I had a bunch of issues with the docuker environment and couldn't get any help to resolve these.

Based on the instructions at https://lbry.tech/resources/wallet-server.

Intended to run on Ubuntu.
